## TASKS THAT NEED TO BE DONE ##

- Set up rails

- Configure Database

### CLARIFICATIONS ###

- Brief states members can CRUD and non members can look. Should full CRUD access be available to to all members, or just to members of the particular project?

- Should members/staff have different access levels to the portfolios? ie. admins able to delete everything, members can only delete their own work

- Portfolio projects, what needs to be stored and do you have preference on how it should be displayed? (show wireframes)
	- Title, description, background-image, link-to-project-repo-github, author-id

- Design!
	- How would you like it to be styled, colour schemes, bootstrap/no, any example websites of what client is thinking.
	- any JS animations required.

- Users, what should be stored? (extra feature)
	- name, email address, password, profile picture, bio, academy-location

## QUESTIONS TO ASK SHIRLEY ##

- What are your highest priority additional features?

- Any other lower priority additional features?

- Should webapp utilise responsive design and be available on a tablet/smartphone?

- should there be a search bar to search for a particular users portfolio?

- Any further security measures required than basic encryption using devise.

- Do you want data validations for forms, and do you have any specifics?

- Would you like integration with other software? ie slack notifications


#### IDEAS FOR EXTRA FEATURES ####


- Should member/public access level be assigned based on whether a sparta email address is registered?
