### Aim ###

The aim of this project was to create a prototype of a portfolio application for Sparta Global employees and trainees. Our breif was to make the application using web technologies which could be hosted online. We had to have full CRUD abilities for admins and Creat and Read abilities for standard users. We have a homepage for users to view all portfolio items as well as their own and a search bar to locate a specific set of articles.  

### Method ###

We built this project primarily using Ruby on Rails, which is built using Ruby and utilises HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies. Alongside the standard gems installed with Rails 5.1.4, we also used Bootstrap, Devise, and CanCan. We used Bootstrap to create a more dynamic method of viewing images, we used Devise to manage the users within the appliaction, and we used CanCan to manage admins within the application.
